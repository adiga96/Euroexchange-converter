# Homework 7 - API Data

Our in-class exercises for the "data visualization" module have introduced you to some basic graphing and data importing concepts.  This assignment is designed to help you enhance your ability to find other sources of interesting data online.

---

- **This is a group assignment.  Your group should have at least two (2), but no more than four (4) students.**
- **If you use an online source or a book, you must cite that source.**

## Assignment Details
1. Find a data source online.  This could be any type of data that you find interesting/useful.  Examples include weather, traffic, public health, sales records, census data, sports statistics, music or movie databases, etc.. 

	There are a few caveats:
	
    a. You cannot use Twitter data (we'll discuss this data in class).

    b. You cannot use Quandl data (we'll discuss this data in class).

    c. Each group must use a different type of data.  There will be a sign-in sheet on GitHub.  Data types will be reserved on a first-come, first-served basis.  *If you study a data type that has already been reserved you will receive a zero (0) on this assignment.* 

    d. The data must be accessed directly from the data source.  You may not download the data manually and then utilize the data offline.  This means you'll probably want to find a web application that offers an API (application programming interface).
	
2. Once you've selected a data source, you must write a python script that will:

    a. Automatically import the data from the online source, and 

    b. Plot/visualize some interesting aspect of this data.
	
	You may utilize sample code online...just make sure to cite all of your references.  *If you submit code that is not your own without proper attribution you will receive a zero (0) on this assignment.*
	
	You will be required to submit your `.py` script(s).
	
3. Additionally, you are required to provide a README summarizing your research.  A template is provided in the `API_Project_Template` repository (https://github.com/IE-555/API_Template).
	
4. Finally, each group will give a five-minute presentation via WebEx so we can all learn from each other.  You should use your README as the visual aide (i.e., do *not* create a separate PowerPoint presentation).  All files will be made available to the class (again, to increase shared learning).

## Submission Requirements
By the due date (see GitHub for the actual date), your group should submit a pull request for a directory containing the following:
1. Your Python code, 
2. A `README.md` file, and 
3. An images directory containing images that appear in the README.

Your directory should be named `USERID1_USERID2_USERID3_USERID4_Keyword`, where the user IDs should be replaced by the UB user names of the group members in ALL CAPS and `Keyword` should be replaced by a single word that describes your data source.
	
NOTE:  Do not email your code.  Submit a pull request.

All groups will be required to submit the electronic materials prior to the online  presentations.

You are given one "free" pull request.  Each additional pull request will cost your team 10 points; make sure you get your code right the first time.
**There will be no pull requests honored after the due date.**

## Presentation Details
Each group will have five (5) minutes to present the results of their research (via the README file).  Groups will be chosen at random during the Thursday morning online class discussion meeting.  

Five minutes isn't very long; you'll have to use your time wisely.  The purpose of the presentation is to give your classmates a basic understanding of the type of data you've studied, some of the key features of the Python script you've submitted (focusing on something new/unique that we didn't cover in class), and some suggestions for what could be done with this data.  You do not have time to discuss the code line-by-line.  However, you should be prepared to answer specific questions about what a particular line of code actually does.
